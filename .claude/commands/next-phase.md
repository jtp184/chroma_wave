Begin the next phase of work as outlined in @./planning/ROADMAP.md

- Determine the specific tasks and milestones for this phase.
  - Interview me as needed for any product direction, questions, clarifications, or additional information.
- Create an implementation plan using the SPARC methodology
  - Break down the implementation plan into non-overlapping and dependency mapped workstreams
  - Specify teammates / subagents to be responsible for each workstream
- Manage the workstreams
  - Regular, isolated commits to the codebase
  - Check off tasks in the roadmap as they are completed
  - If issues or decision points arise that need my input, add tasks to the current phase to collect this feedback
  - Validate the work as it is completed to ensure it meets the requirements and specifications outlined in the roadmap
- Update the roadmap as needed based on any changes in direction, new information, or feedback received during the implementation process.
