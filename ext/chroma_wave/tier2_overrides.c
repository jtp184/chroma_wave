 * Phase 1: Empty placeholder.  Real overrides will be added in a future
 * phase once we have end-to-end hardware validation on each model.
 *
 * The Tier 2 stub infrastructure (stub_init / stub_display) currently
 * lives in driver_registry.c.  When real overrides are implemented,
 * they will be defined here and linked into the tier2_drivers table.
